GroupServer installation
========================

This is the system for installing a GroupServer_ mailing-list
manager. It is named ``buildout`` because it uses `zc.buildout`_
to download and install all the components that make up the
system.

.. _GroupServer: http://groupserver.org/

An up-to-date version of installation documentation for
GroupServer is available at `Read the Docs`_. A copy of the
installation instructions that was current when this version of
GroupServer was packaged is in the file
