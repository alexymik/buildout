GroupServer installation
========================

This is the system for installing a GroupServer_ mailing-list
manager. It is named ``buildout`` because it uses `zc.buildout`_
to download and install all the components that make up the
system.

.. _GroupServer: http://groupserver.org/
.. _zc.buildout: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/

An up-to-date version of installation documentation for
GroupServer is available at `Read the Docs`_. A copy of the
installation instructions that was current when this version of
GroupServer was packaged is in the ``docs`` directory.

The complete documentation for GroupServer can be generated by
installing Sphinx_ and running ``make``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ . ./bin/activate
  $ pip install Sphinx
  $ cd docs

The HTML documentation will be written to the ``_build/html``
folder.
