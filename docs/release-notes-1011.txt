The changes below form the bulk of what is new in the Kulfi release of
GroupServer [#KulfiTickets]_:

* Enhancements to groups, including a `new group properties page`_,
  a `simplified start a group`_ process, and a new `group homepage
  about tab`_. 
* `Easier management of group members`_
* Finally, there have been some `set password enhancements`_ and
  `notification updates`_.
  
Work is now progressing on GroupServer 10.12 — Lemon Ice in the Cool
of the Evening [#LemonIceTickets]_.

New Group Properties Page
=========================

The page used to set the group properties has been simplified [#GroupProperties]_,
following a discussion about what properties a group should have
[#PropertiesTopic]_. There are fewer properties, as many properties
have been replaced by the `group homepage about tab`_. The properties
have also been given clearer names.

The new group properties page is now a standard ``zope.formlib`` form,
rather than relying on the older GroupServer ``XForms`` code. This
means that standard features of forms on GroupServer are present,
such as popup help.

Simplified Start a Group
========================

The start a group system has been simplified to a one-step process
[#StartAGroup]_. Rather than a separate Preview step the new system
dynamically previews the URL and email address of the new group. It
also dynamically checks if the group identifier is unique.

It is not possible to create *announcement* groups with the simplified
system. However, announcement groups are still supported by GroupServer
and will continue to be supported. To create an announcement group
first create a discussion group. Then use the ZMI to change the
``group_template`` property to ``announcement``.

Group Homepage About Tab
========================

The new group homepage about tab replaces the little-used Charter
page [#AboutTab]_. The new tab provides a blank area where a site
administrator is free write anything, using the WYMeditor [#WYMeditor]_.

Easier Management of a Group Members
====================================

A group administrator is now shown a *Manage Member* link when viewing
the profile of a member [#ManageMember]_. This should make managing
members even easier than before.

Set Password Enhancements
=========================

The code used to set and reset passwords has been updated. Members
will be shown better error messages when they follow password-reset
links multiple times [#Password]. In addition all the Set Password
pages have been updated to use a single text entries, rather than two
password entries [#EnClearPasswords].

Notification Updates
====================

Some notifications that have been stored in the ZMI have been [#Notifications]_.
