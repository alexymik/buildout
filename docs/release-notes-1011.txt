The changes below form the bulk of what is new in the Kulfi release of
GroupServer [#KulfiTickets]_. Work is now progressing on GroupServer
10.12 — Lemon Ice in the Cool of the Evening [#LemonIceTickets]_.

New Group Properties Page
=========================


Simplified Start a Group
========================


Group Homepage About Tab
========================


Easier Management of a Group Member
===================================

Set Password Fixes
==================


===============

The user manual and administration manuals are out of date and in
need of work. To help with this a new help system has been introduced
[#Manual]_. It allows for sections of the manuals to be more easily
maintained, which will hopefully allow for better manuals in the future.

Switch to Zope 2.13 Beta
========================

GroupServer now runs on the the latest version of `Zope 2`_. The new
features in Zope are used for the `new group homepage`_, and the `new
help system`_.
