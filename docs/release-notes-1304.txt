Introduction
------------

The seventeen months since the last release of GroupServer (Absinthe). The
hold-up has been the creation of a new-look user-interface for
GroupServer. Almost all the `changes to GroupServer`_ are user-visible, and
include a new notifications, and updated systems for adding people. You can
`get Ouzo`_ immediately.

----------------------
Changes to GroupServer
----------------------

The most significant change to GroupServer in the Ouzo release is the `new
style pages`_. In addition the system for `adding people`_ in bulk has been
updated hugely, there has been an extensive `notifications update`_ and
`other updates`_

New style pages
===============

The main update to GroupServer has been the implementation of new pages on
the Web interface (see `Issue 3423`_). The pages have been integrated with
`Twitter Bootstrap`_, and the navigation_ has been extensively
reworked. The `profile images`_ are now (mostly) square, with new code to
improve their performance. In addition the pages have been made more
responsive_, and the performance_ has been improved.

.. _issue 3423: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3423

The pages were redesigned by...

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

The GroupServer user-interface is now based on `Twitter Bootstrap
2.3`_. The look of ever single page has changed significantly as a
consequence. 

.. _Twitter Bootstrap 2.3: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/

The tabs, on the Group page and site page, have dropped the use of
jQuery.UI tabs in favour of the Bootstrap Tabs. The Popover class is used
to show information including the privacy of a group and posts,
encouragement for the new administrator, and the Share widget.

Navigation
----------

The navigation scheme for GroupServer has changed dramatically in this
release, moving away from the context-menu (along the left), and dropping
the site-menu (along the top) entirely. In their place is a system based on
breadcrumbs (see `Issue 3510`_).

.. _Issue 3510: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3510

The Profile page is the only page left that makes use of the context-menu.

Profile images
--------------

Another major change has been with the profile images. The are now shown in
more places, at `multiple resolutions`_. In addition most of the images are
square_.

Multiple resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The profile-images in releases of GroupServer prior to Ouzo were restricted
to 81×108 pixels. Now the content provider is able supply profile photos at
a range of resolutions (see `Issue 588`_). In addition the `image
compression`_ enhancements have also been rolled out to the profile photo,
so small photos are now directly embedded into the page.

.. _Issue 588: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/588

Square
~~~~~~

The profile photos are now square by default. These square photos are shown
in more places, such as in the new *Recently active* list on the *Group*
page (see `Issue 3873`_), the *Profile* link at the top of every page, and
the *Post message* area of the *Topic* and *Start topic* pages.

.. _Issue 3873: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3873

Responsive
----------

The new design of the GroupServer web pages is responsive to the size of
device. This allows the pages to look good from screens found on desktops,
down to small feature phones. This allows people to keep up with
conversations anywhere and any time. Some pages, such as the Image page
(see `Issue 3508`_) have had particular attention to ensure the page works
well at multiple sizes.

.. _Issue 3508: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3508

Performance
-----------

The performance Web interface has been massively improved. The primary way
of doing this has been with `refactored JavaScript`_. In addition `image
compression`_ has been increased and `font icons`_ introduced. Finally,
many small changes have been made to the layout of the pages to reduce the
*time to glass.*

Refactored JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the JavaScript used by GroupServer has been refactored into separate
modules (see `Issue 344`_). This makes documentation and maintenance far
easier, at the expense of speed. To compensate, all JavaScript (including
that supplied by jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap) is deferred until after the
paged has been shown. In addition, all the JavaScript has been *minified*
to reduce the amount of data that is transported, and to speed the parsing
by the Web browser. Finally, almost all the JavaScript is *asynchronously*
loaded.

.. _Issue 344: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/344

Image compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many photos that are posted by group members have very low compression (or
very high quality, depending how you like to look at it). GroupServer now
produces thumbnails with aggressive compression by default (see `Issue
663`_), reducing the quality as the image becomes smaller, and making the
images far smaller. When images are *particularly* small a data-URI is used
to directly embed the image into the page, reducing the need to make an
HTTP request to fetch the image.

.. _Issue 663: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/663

Font icons
~~~~~~~~~~

The new user-interface uses a font to provide the different icons in the
interface (see `Issue 3788`_). These are quick to load and render. In
addition they are independent of the resolution of the device, so work well
in the new responsive_ user interface.

.. _Issue 3788: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3788

Adding people
=============

The system for adding people to a group has undergone many improvements,
primarily to the pages that allow the new member details to be uploaded by
CSV, but also to the system that allow existing site members to be invited
to join a group.

The system for adding people in bulk, using a CSV file
https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3494

On a more minor note, the page for inviting site members to join a group
has been enhanced with the addition of email-addresses, which helps
distinguish between people with similar names (see `Issue 452`_).

.. [#noSearch] The *Search* box that used to appear on every page has now
               been removed, as it is easier to use the *Search* entry in
               the *Topics* tab.
