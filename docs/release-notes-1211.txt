Introduction
============

There are sixteen major `changes to GroupServer`_ in the Absinthe release —
making the system more useful, usable and extensible for both group
members, administrators, and developers. You can `get Absinthe`_
immediately.

Acknowledgements

Changes to GroupServer
======================

The `changes visible to participants`_ are mostly improvements to existing
features, rather than new features. In contrast, the `changes to the
underlying system`_ are complex and extensive.

Changes Visible to Participants
--------------------------------

The most visible change that is visible to the participants is a `new
search system`_.  Some `better error pages`_ for when things go wrong have
also been created. To help participants and administrators there is a `new
help system`_, while `an in-context administration guide`_ will help
administrators get their new group going more easily. Administrators now
have the ability to create `closed groups`_, and the new `profile search`_
will help administrators fine participant's profiles.

New Search System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * A new full-text retrieval system, taking full advantage of PostgreSQL.
..  * A new keyword generation system that is faster and better.

The new search system is the most visible change in Absinthe. 

* The *Topics* tab on both the site homepage and the group page have a
  *Search* entry [#noSearch]_.
* The *Posts* tab in a group has as *Search* entry also, allowing posts to
  be searched [#postSearch]_.
* Clicking on a topic keyword with search for other topics with that
  keyword [#clickableKW]_.
* Searching now uses *stems*; for example, searching for ``search`` will
  match topics that contain the words ``searches``, ``searching`` or
  ``searched``.
* Searching is now much faster, as the full-text retrieval features of
  PostgreSQL_ are used [#FTR]_.
* The display of topics in a site or group is much faster, as the keywords
  are now generated when someone posts, rather than when the topic is
  loaded.
* Non-ASCII characters can now be searched [#nonAscii]_

Better Error Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * Better error pages.

The *Permission Denied* page has been improved to add some suggestions
about what the participant should do [#forbidden]_. In addition the
``mailto`` that is embedded in the page now includes the URL of the problem
page in the body of the email message to the Support address.

New Help System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * New help pages 

The old monolithic manuals have been replaced. The new more dynamic system
will automatically show help for the features that are installed in
GroupServer, including the custom features. Some of the old pages have been
retained and updated.

An In-Context Administration Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * An in-context guide to group administrators to make it easier to get
..    started.

To help get groups started there is a new system to encourage the group
administrator along the way [#encouragement]_. The current advice includes:

* Start a topic
* Invite people, 
* Write some text in the *About* tab, and
* Make a group Private (rather than Secret).


Closed Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * The ability to close a group.

Administrators can now close groups [#closed]_. There are two reasons for this. 

#. The group may be *starting*, and the administrator does not want the
   members to post until everyone is in the group.
#. The group may be *finished*, and the administrator does not want any
   more posts to be made, but he or she still wants the archive available.

While there is no front-end user interface that allows the group-type to be
changed, an administrator can change the type of the group by making a
change in the ZMI.

Profile Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * A new (basic) profile-search system.

A simple profile search has been added [#profileSearch]_. A more complex
search system has not been added because the privacy issues are still being
resolved.

SVG Thumbnails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to Bill Bushey, GroupServer now correctly displays the thumbnail of
SVG images [#svg]_.

Changes to the Underlying System
--------------------------------

Configuration System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * A new configuration system, to make email and database setup easier.

Relstorage
~~~~~~~~~~
..  * Using relstorage as the default storage system for the ZMI.

Redis
~~~~~
..  * Optionally using the redis cache-server to improve performance.

SQL Alchemy Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * Switching to the *latest* version of sqlalchemy, rather than the
..    ancient version we were stuck on.

Bug 203 https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/203

New Site Homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
..  * A new flexible site homepage.

..    to use.
..  * Better (XVERP) bounce-handling.
