Introduction
============

The two main update to GroupServer that is present in the Soft Serve
release [#SoftServe]_ are an update to the code that determines if
someone `can post`_, and a rebuild of the `site administration pages`_.
In addition there are other `minor fixes`_ that have been made. You
can `get Soft Serve`_ immediately. Work is now starting on GroupServer
11.07 — Frozen Yoghurt Accompanied by Carols [#FrozenYoghurt]_.
