Changes to GroupServer
----------------------

The most extensive change in Calvados is the
internationalisation_. There are also `updated email commands`_,
in addition to `minor code improvements`_.

Internationalisation
====================

`Alice Murphy`_ has lead an effort to add internationalisation to
GroupServer_. So far internationalisation has been added to the
following products

* The core page template that lays out the page
* The Join page
* The site homepage **[TODO]**
* The group page **[TODO]**
* The topic page **[TODO]**
* The post page **[TODO]**
* The image page **[TODO]**

Updated email commands
======================

The system for handling email commands have been completely
rewritten and improved. Five commands are currently supported.

:``Unsubscribe``: This is the most commonly used command. It
              removes the group-member that sent the command from
              the group. See `the gs.group.member.leave product`_
              for more information.
:``Subscribe``: This used to join a **public** group. A person
            who registers this way will be unable to log in,
            because he or she will have no password. In addition
            public groups are rare it has limited use. However,
            tradition dictates that a ``Subscribe`` command is
            supported. See `the gs.group.member.subscribe
            product`_ for more information.
:``Confirm``: This message, the companion to ``Subscribe``, is
              used to ensure that a person wants to join a
              group. See `the gs.group.member.subscribe product`_
              for more information.
:``Digest on``: This is used to switch to the topic-digest. See
              `the gs.group.member.email.settings product`_ for
              more information.
:``Digest off``: This is used to switch to one email per
              post. See `the gs.group.member.email.settings
              product`_ for more information.
