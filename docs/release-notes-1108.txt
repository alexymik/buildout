Introduction
============

The main update that is present in the Banana release of GroupServer is
a `Facebook signup`_ system. You can `get Banana Split`_ immediately. 
Work is now starting on GroupServer 11.09 — Bombe Glacée with Emphasis 
on the Phonetics.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to `Steven Clift`_ for his support for the `Facebook signup`_
system.

Facebook Signup
===============

Previously, new members had to provide all their profile information
during signup. Now new members have the option of logging into Facebook
to retrieve the profile information. Signing up using Facebook is 
beneficial in two ways.

#.  The email address of the new member does not have to be verified, as
    Facebook has already verified the address.

#.  Much of the profile information does not have to be added, as it
    is copied in from Facebook.

Get Banana Split
================

To get Banana Split go to `the Downloads page for GroupServer`_ and
follow `the GroupServer Installation documentation`_. Those who already
have a functioning installation can `update an existing GroupServer
system`_.

-------------------------------------

To update an existing GroupServer system to Banana Split you must
update the packages.

To upgrade the packages in an existing GroupServer system to Banana 
Split carry out the following steps.

#.  Download the Banana Split tar-ball from `the GroupServer download 
    page <http://groupserver.org/downloads>`_.
