Introduction
============

The `changes to GroupServer`_ in the Faloodeh release cover sites, 
groups and profiles — making them all more usable and extensible. You 
can `get Faloodeh`_ immediately.

Changes to GroupServer
======================

The changes in Faloodeh are mostly `group improvements`_, `profile improvements`_ and a new `site homepage`_. In addition there are `minor
changes`_

Group Improvements
------------------

The most visible change to groups in this release of GroupServer is to 
the `notifications`_. However, the primary improvement is new code to 
determine if someone `can post`_ to a group. Underlying this is a system
for `more extensible groups`_.

Minor changes to groups include the following.

Better Links in Posts:
  Now ``http://youtu.be`` links are turned into embedded YouTube 
  videos, and ``www.`` "links" are turned into hypertext links.

Rest of Post Button:
  The button to show the *remainder* of a post (normally just 
  bottom-quoted text) is now labelled "Rest of post".

Public Access Period:
  The default public access period for files is now set to 72 hours.
  This is the period that no password is required to access a file, 
  making it easier for users of email to access the files.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Four notifications have been rewritten. There are HTML versions of both  

* The *Welcome* message, which is sent to new group members, and 
* The *New Member* notification, which is sent to the administrator when
  someone joins a group.

The *Invitation* to join a group has undergone a rewrite too, along with
a new default invitation-message from the group-administrator.

Finally, the *Cannot Post* notification has undergone an extensive 
change, along with the rest of the `can post`_ system. It now has a
HTML variant, as well as a wording change to (hopefully) make it easer
to understand.

Can Post
~~~~~~~~

The biggest change to groups was a complete rewrite of the system that
determines if a user can post. This system is used to 

* Send an email to someone who tries to post but is disallowed, and
* To tell someone using the web why he or she cannot post *before* they
  try to post.

The Can Post system is now self-documenting, and it allows for `more 
extensible groups`_.

More Extensible Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along with the new `can post`_ code, the definition of what 
*constitutes* a group has been redefined. GroupServer has always 
supported three different types of group: 

Discussion Group:
  A group where only group members can post.
  
Announcement Group:
  A group where only certain group-members can post.

Support Group:
  A group where anyone can post, but only group-members can view the
  posts.

These group-types previously existed as a set of configuration options.
Now there are specific marker-interfaces for each of these group-types.
Currently only the `can post`_ system uses them extensively, but other
systems will follow in the future.

Profile Improvements
--------------------

The primary improvements to profiles is a new *Verify Email Address*
notification. Like the new `notifications`_ in the group, the new
Verify email message has a HTML version, which is shown by default by
most email clients. The wording of the Verify email has also been 
changed, so it is hopefully easier to understand.

All the notifications with an HTML component are possible because of a 
new system for sending notifications. This system is documented as part
of the ``gs.profile.notify`` component.
