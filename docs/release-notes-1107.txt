Introduction
============

The main update that is present in the Frozen Yoghurt [#FrozenYoghurt]_
release of GroupServer  is a `new stylesheet`_ for devices with
narrow displays. There is also a new converter for `HTML-formatted
messages`_. In addition a number of `minor fixes`_ are part of this
release. You can `get Frozen Yoghurt`_ immediately. Work is now starting
on GroupServer 11.08 — Banana Split Eaten in a Comfortable Silence
[#BananaSplit]_.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to `Steven Clift`_ for his support with the `new stylesheet`_.

New Stylesheet
==============

Devices with narrow displays, such as mobile phones and tablets, now have
a dedicated stylesheet [#NewCSS]_. The system uses `CSS3 Media Queries`_
to reformat the page when the browser window is narrow. Pages that have
been specifically optimised for small-screen devices include

* The site homepage, 
* The group page, 
* The topic page and 
* The image page. 

Many other pages work on small screens, including the post page and
the topics page.

HTML-Formatted Messages
=======================

Email messages can be in multiple formats, including plain text and HTML.
Sometimes email messages are formatted in *just* HTML. When this occurs
GroupServer converts the HTML version of the message into a plain-text
version. It is this plain-text version of the post that is displayed on
the Web pages. The code that converts the HTML-message into plain-text
has been updated [#Converter]_. The new code uses `the standard Python
HTML Parser library`_ to parse the message, and also handles URLs better.

Minor Fixes
===========

Minor fixes in Frozen Yoghurt include the following.

* The position of the Sticky form in a topic has been moved, so it is
  visible when there is only one post [#Sticky]_.
  
* Files that are part of hidden posts are hidden from the index of files
  at the top of the topic. (Files that were part of hidden posts were
  never able to be viewed) [#Hidden]_.

* A new configuration system for GroupServer is present, but not used. 
  The ``gs.option`` product is part of an ongoing effort to move more
  data out of the ZODB and into the `PostgreSQL`_ relational database.
  The ``README`` in the base of the product has more details.

* An error with the Can Post code was fixed.

* The word *Home* has been dropped from the group page, as it added
  nothing and took up valuable space.
